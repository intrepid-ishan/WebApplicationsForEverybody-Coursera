    //This means the language supports passing functions as arguments to other functions,
    //returning them as the values from other functions, and assigning them to variables
    //or storing them in data structures.
    //#example
    //lets say we have 100s of function and in 66th function we need 32nd function then
    //we will be passing it as an argument
    an = new PartyAnimal();
