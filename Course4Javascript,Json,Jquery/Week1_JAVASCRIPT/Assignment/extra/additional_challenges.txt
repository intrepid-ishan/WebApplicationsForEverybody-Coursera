Optional Challenges
This section is entirely optional and is here in case you want to explore a bit more deeply and test your code skillz.
Here are some possible improvements:


Add an optional URL field to your tables and user interface.
Validate the URL to make sure it starts with "http://" or "https://". 
It is OK for this to be blank. 
If this is non-blank show the image in the table view in index.php and in the view.php file.




Medium Difficulty: Use the PHP cURL library to do a GET to the image URL from within PHP and if the URL does not exist,
                             issue an error message to the user and do not add the profile.




This is a bit tricky so please don't try if it feels confusing. 
Change the program so it supports multiple users and each user can only edit or delete profiles that match their user_id. 
Insert a second row into the users table with the same or a diffferent hashed password.
This way you can log in with one user name, add some profiles, logout and log in as another user,
add some profiles and then logout and log back in as the original user and the Edit/Delete buttons will only appear for the profiles owned by the user.



Advanced: Change the index.php so that it has a search field. Use the LIKE operator in the WHERE clause. 
                 You can use a LIKE operator on any column (including numbers) and you can use the LIKE column on all of the columns as well.




Super Advanced: If there are more than 10 profiles, only show 10 at a time and put up Next and Back buttons as appropriate.
                            Use count query to determine number of rows and a a LIMIT clause in your tables query to return the correct range of rows.
